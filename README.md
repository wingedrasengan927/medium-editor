## Installation

### 1. Install Peer Dependencies

Before installing the main package, you need to ensure that all its peer dependencies are present in your project. This package assumes you are working within a React environment, so `react` and `react-dom` should ideally already be part of your project setup.

The primary peer dependencies you need to install are:

*   `@lexical/react`: ">=0.39.0"
*   `@tabler/icons-react`: ">=3.31.0"
*   `lexical`: ">=0.39.0"
*   `react-aria-components`: ">=1.8.0"

You can install them using npm. Adjust the versions if needed to match your project's requirements, ensuring they meet the minimum versions specified above.

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm install @lexical/react @tabler/icons-react lexical react-aria-components
```

### 2. Install Package

Once the peer dependencies are installed, you can proceed to install the main package.

To install the `lexical-medium-editor` package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install lexical-medium-editor
```
